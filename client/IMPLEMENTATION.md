# Implementation Steps for FastAPI OpenAI RAG Client

This document outlines the steps taken to implement the FastAPI OpenAI RAG CLI client.

## 1. Project Setup

1. Created a dedicated client directory structure:
   ```
   client/
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── README.md
   └── src/
       └── ygo74/
           └── fastapi_openai_rag_client/
               ├── __init__.py
               ├── __main__.py
               ├── commands/
               │   ├── groups.py
               │   ├── models.py
               │   └── users.py
               └── core/
                   ├── auth.py
                   └── client.py
   ```

2. Defined dependencies in pyproject.toml:
   - knack: CLI framework (similar to Azure CLI)
   - requests: HTTP client
   - keyring: Secure storage for API keys
   - cachetools: TTL-based caching

3. Set up entry point script to make the client executable as `rag-client`

## 2. Core Components

### Authentication (auth.py)

1. Implemented dual authentication methods:
   - API Key authentication with secure storage via keyring
   - OAuth2/Keycloak authentication with token refresh

2. Added token caching with TTL to minimize authentication overhead:
   - Tokens stored securely in ~/.rag-client/token_cache.json
   - Automatic token refresh when expired

3. Environment variable configuration for flexible deployment

### API Client (client.py)

1. Created base API client with authenticated requests
2. Implemented endpoints for all resources:
   - Users
   - Groups
   - Models
   - User-Group associations
   - Model-Group associations

3. Added error handling and response validation

## 3. Command Modules

### Group Commands (groups.py)

1. Implemented CRUD operations for groups:
   - List groups
   - Get group by ID
   - Create group
   - Update group
   - Delete group

2. Added argument validation and help text

### Model Commands (models.py)

1. Implemented CRUD operations for models:
   - List models
   - Get model by ID
   - Create model
   - Update model
   - Delete model

2. Added group association commands:
   - Add model to group
   - Remove model from group
   - List models in group

### User Commands (users.py)

1. Implemented CRUD operations for users:
   - List users
   - Get user by ID or username
   - Create user
   - Update user
   - Deactivate user

2. Added API key management:
   - Create user API key

3. Added authentication commands:
   - Login with username/password
   - Logout
   - Set API key

## 4. CLI Entry Point

1. Set up Knack CLI framework:
   - Command tree structure
   - Help text and documentation
   - Argument parsing

2. Implemented command loader to register all commands

3. Added version command for easy version checking

## 5. Documentation

1. Created README.md with installation and usage instructions
2. Added examples for each command type
3. Documented environment variables and configuration options

## 6. Testing and Validation

1. Tested authentication flows
2. Validated CRUD operations against the API
3. Verified error handling and edge cases
